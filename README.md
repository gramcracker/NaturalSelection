# NaturalSelection
An Evolutionary simulator where two teams compete to evolve.

## How it works
There are two teams with an equal amount of either red or green "bots". Each team takes turns trying to kill the other team. Each turn is a session lasting 15 seconds. At the end of each session, random mutations will occur to the team with less bots. When only one team is left, the winning teams logic will be copied to the losing team. 

## Todo:
  - Add RNN
  
  
## prerequisites: 
As of now, pygame must be installed which is only supported up to python 3.8, as well as numpy
